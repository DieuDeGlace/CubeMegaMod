## Usage
For v.0.3.0, the usage is the following:

Going underwater will spawn random fishes around you. For now they are all friendly, but this will change.
Going underwater usually drains stamina. 
This is still the case, however you can now use dragon roots to get the underwater breathing ability, meaning that your stamina will not get reduced, for the duration the dragon roots are active.
Dragon roots give 10s of underwater breathing. 
They are automatically used when underwater.

- You can spawn fish by typing `/fish 100`, which will spawn 100 fish around you. [Pre-release only]
- You can spawn chests by typing `/chest 0`, which will spawn a chest with type 0. Types are 0 - 3. [Pre-release only]
- You can add 3 dragon roots to your inventory by typing `/roots`. This can be done any number of times, so stack them up a bit before you go and test out the mod. [Pre-release only]

New combat abilities are added as well. 
- The movement keys (WASD) can be double tapped for movement abilities (WAD) and an attack ability (S). The costs of these ability is currently 75 stamina.
- The 1 key converts your mana to stamina.
- The 2 key restores you to full health at the cost of 50 combo.

Lore interactions are updated. Every lore you read that gives 100+ percent lore, an artifact will be dropped.
