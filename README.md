# CubeMegaMod
This is a large mod for CubeWorld steam version. It adds / will add underwater exploration, combat modifications,
lore improvements, new item consumables, gold usages and more.

## Installing
Throw the `.dll` of one of the releases in your mod folder.

## Usage
For v.0.2, the usage is the following:

Going underwater will spawn random fishes around you. For now they are all friendly, but this will change.
Going underwater usually drains stamina. 
This is still the case, however you can now use dragon roots to get the underwater breathing ability, meaning that your stamina will not get reduced, for the duration the dragon roots are active.
Dragon roots give 10s of underwater breathing. 
They are automatically used when underwater.

- You can spawn fish by typing `/fish 100`, which will spawn 100 fish around you. (For testing)
- You can spawn chests by typing `/chest 0`, which will spawn a chest with type 0. Types are 0 - 3.
- You can add 3 dragon roots to your inventory by typing `/roots`. This can be done any number of times, so stack them up a bit before you go and test out the mod.
